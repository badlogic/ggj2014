Dodgeball Hospital
==================
Our team's Global Game Jam 2014 entry. 

## Game
Dodgeball Hospital is a frantic hack n' slash game. You're trapped in an insance asylum, trying to get out. Your brain is telling you you are surrounded by monsters, thirsting for your blood. 

### [Download (Windows/Linux/Mac)](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/downloads/dodgeball-hospital.jar)

## Code
The game is written in Java, using [Libgdx](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com). To modify and compile it, install the requirements for libgdx (Eclipse, JDK), clone this repository, and import all projects into your Eclipse workspace. To run the game on the Desktop, right click the ggj2014-desktop project in the Eclipse package explorer, select Run As -> Java Application

The game was made within 48h without any considerations for mobile platforms. We'll probably fix up our worst algorithmic offenders to make it run on Android and iOS, as well as in your browser. If you want to give that a try, see Enemy.java which features nice O(n^2) implementations for a few things :)
